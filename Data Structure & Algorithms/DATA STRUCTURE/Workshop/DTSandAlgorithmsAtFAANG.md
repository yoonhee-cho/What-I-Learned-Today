## DTS & Algorithms at FAANG Companies
- by Michael Mroczka
- (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, Google)

- why important?
1. Football ? : fundamental building block
2. Interviews are getting harder :(
3. salary, promotion chances and etc

- Communication/ Problem Solving /Verification(catching edge cases in the beginning/before after problem solving code)/  Syntax

- What you don't need to worry about
1. Brain teasers
2. Math
3. Memorizing library info
4. Learing a specific language for interviewing

- Leetcode 700 questions =_= ;;;;

- 2 medium leetcode questions in one hr is a good level to pass the interview
- Big-O
- nested loops do not indicate big - 0 time complexity
- depends on the input size
- how good the func is / CPU LAM / time space
- N * LOG(N) vs log(n)
- factorial ??
- 인풋어레이길이에 상관없이 항상 똑같은 길이의 넘버를 이터레잇해서 컨스턴트임 .. 


## Q&A
- side project(3-4 moret han 2, less than 4): 1. show i know something, api works, authentication, to discuss in the interview, why do I choose the teck stack 
- 2months, 4 projects
- contribute to open source, hard but makes you stand out
- how to make you stand out : know framework associated with the language, 
- x going thru clear??
- how to solve problem quickly? : camera set up and record myself with timer, talking to camera code the brute force -> optimization
- having high level plan - 7 mins i do this, 10 mins I do this
- forcing yourself into the time frame
- SQL question, : is not common 
- website =  github pages  
- matrix - dfs or bs start seeing pattern

## pre-order, in-order 

## backtracking with decision trees
- Decision Trees : reach a solution by making a sequence of decisions
- feasibiliy : y n
- enumeration : every cases (cannot do better,) = backtracking
- counting : how many solutions
- optimization :

- backtracking = exponential bad time complexity
- DP : Dynamic Programming : building diff combination, ????? memoization

## Graphs
- why graphs so hard? -> summary of everything

- DFS  & BFS 
- target row, target columnm : what would you change about the code ? : adjust ????????????????????????????
 

## DP
- explain like i am five kk
-  remembering stuff to save time later 
- independent answers 
- 2 diff ways to doing samething
1. tabulation 
2. memoization
- solve problem with dfs ->  
- ASK template 100% way to solve the problem
- add memo, storage, key

## Q & A 
- Log 2 base, no matter what the base is , base doesn't matter

- Michael you suggested Coding Bat for recursion last time I saw you and it was amazing lol truly helped me understand

- scott young ultralearning

- email resume link to auto
- dramatic - bouncy ball with resume
- wacky being noticed dramatic
- try something original
- cold outreach personally : 
- 1 hr screen -> data structures 4
